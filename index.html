            <p> I am a life-long learner and dedicated worker.  
                I have achieved a Bachelor of Science degree from Bradley University, a Masters of Education degree from DePaul University and most recently, I am working on a certification through Northwestern for Full Stack Development Coding.    
              Throughout my previous employment, I have developed strong problem solving skills for unique situation, aligned with paitience and flexibility to see the situation through.
            <p>
              To date I have experience in working with Gitbash, Github, Gitlab,
              and focused on coding in HTML and CSS languages.
              I am eager for the future and what is to come.  The more that I learn about coding the more that I want to learn!
